# ElementaryAutomata
Similar to Conway's Game of Life, elementary cellular automata represent the progression of cells as they switch between two states, off or on. Unlike Conway's Game of Life though, elementary cellular automata are one-dimensional and update cells in only one direction, typically downwards. To create an elementary cellular automata, a number is selected from 0-255, converted into an 8bit binary number, and then used to determine the states, true or false, of the eight 3bit rules corresponding to the index position of the binary number.
